Data is interpreted, called _information_

_Data_ - letters, numbers, graphics, representing reality and knowledge

_Information_ - organized represented by someone

_Knowledge_ - represented a pattern

- interpret the information

- embedded in software -- e.g. mathematical operations

- information read, heard, or seen, and understood

_Wisdom_ - distilled and integrated knowledge and understanding

_Business Intelligence_ - information management pertaining to an organization's policy or decision making, particularly when tied to strategic or operational objectives

_Intelligence Cycle_ - is the process of developing raw information into finished intelligence for policy makers to use in decision making and action.

1. Planning and Direction -

2. Collection - open source

3. Processing - converting

4. Analysis and Production - include integrating, evaluation, analysis

5. Dissemination - using of intelligence products

## Concept of Information System

```bash
IT --> users == Information System (IS) -- supports --> Information Knowledge
```

## Types of Information System

- Operational Supports - transaction processing system -- Operational Management Level

- Support and Knowledge Work - business intelligence, office information system, knowledge management system -- Tactical Management Level

- Management Support - executive information system, management reporting system, decision support system -- Strategic Management Level

**Management Information System (MIS)** - are planned system of collecting, sharing, and dissemination data in the form of information.

## Role of MIS

- can be compared to the role of heart in the body

- the information is the blood and MIS is the heart. In the body, the heart plays the role of resupplying pure blood to all

- the elements of the body including the brain

- MIS plays exactly the same role in the organizations

- the system ensures that an appropriate data is collected from the various sources, processed, and seat further to all the needy organization.

- the system is expected to fulfil the information needs of an individual, a group of individuals, the management functionaries -- managers and top level management.

- the MIS satisfies the diverse needs through a variety of systems such as query systems, analysis systems, modeling systems, and decision support systems.

- the MIS helps in strategic planning, management control, operational

## Features of MIS

- Timeline

- Accuracy

- Consistency

- Completeness

- Relevance

**Transaction Process System (TPS)** - Computerized system that performs and records daily routine transactions necessary to the conduct of the business.

## Benefits of MIS

- Improve personal efficiency

- Expedite problem solving

- Facilitate interpersonal communication

- Promotes learning and training

- Increase organization control

## Tools

- Data Warehouse

- Outline Analytical Processing (OLAP)

- Data Mining and Advance Technologies

## Guidelines of Effective Design

- System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - used by PNP
