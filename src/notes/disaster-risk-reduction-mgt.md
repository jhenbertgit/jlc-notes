# Disaster Risk Reduction Management

## Basic Concept

- Concept of Disaster

- Concept of Disaster Risk

- Nature of Disasters

- Effects of Disaster

### Disaster

- can be natural or human made -- without warning or notice

### Disaster Risk

- is potential for loss or damage due to disaster

  - Combination of _Hazard_, _Exposure_, and _Vulnerability_

### Effects of Disaster

- Loss of life

- Damage to property

- Destruction of critical infrastructure

- Damage to environment

- Financial loss

- Diversion of resources

- Epidemics

- Migration

- Displaced people or refugees

- Food shortages

- Insecurity

### Natural Disaster (events)

- Typhoon

- Volcanic eruption

  - disruption of buildings -- immediate effect
  - long-term -- changes in environment

- Tsunami - seismic sea waves

  - long-term effect economic and social impact
  - causes:
    - from earthquake

- Flood - occur when water overflow to land not usually with water

  - impact:
    - long term and short-term
  - immediate effect:
    - loss of life
  - long-term:
    - social large displacement

- Earthquake - cause significant damage to buildings

- Landslide - landslips or mud slide

  - masses of rocks or earth downfall slopes
  - factors:
    - heavy rainfall
    - volcanic eruption
    - human activities -- mining, construction

## Events

- Catastrophic events - loss of life

- Non-catastrophic events - without loss of life

### When does Natural disaster become Hazards?

- When poses threat to society, life, community

- cause damage or harm

## Hazard

- a phenomenon that poses threat to people, structures, or economic assets.

### Global Hazards

- earthquake, rockfalls, land slide

### Hydrological

- drought, flood

### Meteorological

- typhoon, storm

### Biological

- virus (Covid-19)

## Natural Hazard

- natural event or process which affects people causing loss of life, injury

- often unpredictable

How hazard become disaster?

- damage to life

**disaster** -- exceeds coping capacity of a society or community

## Factors of Hazards to Become Disaster

- Vulnerability

- Exposure

- Lack of preparedness

- Complexity of situation

**Disaster Risk** - refers to the expectation value of deaths, injuries, and property losses that would caused by a hazard

Reducing Exposure and Vulnerability

- exposure -- e.g. implementation of building codes

Community-based Disaster Risk Reduction Management

- Build-Back-Better-Program

Why people resistive to relocation?

- turned a blind eye (not aware or do not consider a hazard)

- giving their homes

- financial

Characteristics of Disaster

- inherently unexpected

- cannot be manage

- create demands beyond the capacity of a gov't

- no political boundary

- requires structured new organization

### Impact of Disaster

- medical effect

- damage to critical facilities

- disruption of transportation

- economic impact

- global environmental change

- social and political impact

## National Disaster Risk Reduction Management

National Disaster Coordinating Council - October 10, 1970 -- under DND

**Function:**

- Center for government and private sector coordination

**Philippine Disaster Management Framework:**

- Comprehensive policy to guide in disaster

- established -- RA 10121

- aims to reduce the vulnerability

## Disaster Management

- **Mitigation**

  - action taken to reduce impact of disaster before it happen

  1. Proactive - aim to reduce vulnerability by decreasing risk while coping with the hazards
  2. Main measures

  - Insurance from natural calamities
  - Regulations - e.g. strict implementation of fire and building code

  Mitigation Best Practice

  - Hazard mapping and risk assessment
  - Implementation of building codes and standards
  - Public education and awareness training campaigns

- **Preparedness**

  - action and measures before the disaster
  - design to minimize loss of life and property
  - capacity building for community -- e.g. training, skills, simulations
  - established early warning system

  **Contingency Planning**

  Best Practices:

  - Build community awareness
  - Involve stakeholders
  - Develop multi-hazard approaches

- **Response**

  - one of the component in disaster risk reductions

  **Activities:**

  - search and rescue
  - evacuation and sheltering
  - medical assistance

  **Phases of Disasters Response**

  - Pre-disaster Phase -- period before disaster
  - Emergency Response Phase -- search and rescue
  - Recovery Phase -- restore normalcy, reconstruction

  **Best Practice in Disaster Response**

  - Strong coordination among stakeholders
  - Prepositioning of relief supplies
  - Capacity building and training

- **Rehabilitation (recovery)**

  - longest and most difficult stage of the framework
  - process of restoring the normalcy in society

  **Phases of Rehabilitation/Recovery**

  - Short-term recovery
  - Medium-term recovery
  - Long-term recovery

  **Strategies for Rehabilitation/Recovery**

  - Economic Recovery - focused livelihood, job opportunity
  - Physical Infrastructure Recovery - involves extensive planning
  - Social Infrastructure Recovery - rebuild religious infrastructure, churches

  **Best Practices for Rehabilitation/Recovery**

  - Build-back-better program -- ensure building resilient for future disaster
  - Collaboration and Community -- involves NGO, affected community
  - Comprehensive Planning

## Sendai Framework

- global agreement that aims to reduce disaster risk and promote disaster resilience

  **Key Element**

  - strengthening
